If you are working on a wired connection within the university,
just go to this address
https://scc.umb.edu:8555/lab?

and use password: poweradearepa

I am using a custom ssl certificate, so you can safely ignore
warnings of secure connections. Just add exception when asked.
You might to hit the "advanced" button or something like that.

If you are using WiFi or if at home, you will need to use
ssh tunneling

$ ssh -L ssh -L 8555:scc.umb.edu:8555 users.cs.umb.edu

and then just go to
https://localhost:8888/lab?

same password.
